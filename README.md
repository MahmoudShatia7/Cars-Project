## 🔍 Overview

This project processes a real-world used car dataset containing features like **make**, **model**, **year**, **mileage**, **engine specifications**, and **price**. The goal is to clean, visualize, and analyze the data comprehensively, laying a robust foundation for future predictive modeling.

The workflow includes:
- 📊 **Exploration & Visualization** ([`00_exploration.ipynb`](https://github.com/MahmoudShatia7/Cars-Project/blob/master/notebooks/00_exploration.ipynb))
- 🔧 **Data Preprocessing**: handling missing values, encoding, feature cleaning ([`01_preprocessing.ipynb`](https://github.com/MahmoudShatia7/Cars-Project/blob/master/notebooks/01_preprocessing.ipynb))
- 🧠 **Analytics & Insights**: correlation analysis, trend detection, aggregations ([`02_analytics.ipynb`](https://github.com/MahmoudShatia7/Cars-Project/blob/master/notebooks/02_analytics.ipynb))

## 📌 Usage
### 🔹 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Understand the structure, key variables, distributions, and outliers:

➡️ [00_exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/MahmoudShatia7/Cars-Project/blob/master/notebooks/00_exploration.ipynb)


### 🔹 2. Data Preprocessing
Clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical features, and prepare it for analysis:


➡️ [01_preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/MahmoudShatia7/Cars-Project/blob/master/notebooks/01_preprocessing.ipynb)


### 🔹 3. Analytics & Insights
Analyze the cleaned dataset for trends, pricing patterns, and brand performance:

➡️ [02_analytics.ipynb](https://github.com/MahmoudShatia7/Cars-Project/blob/master/notebooks/02_analytics.ipynb)

## 📊 Findings

Some key insights from the analysis include:

   - Average Price by Brand: Revealed pricing hierarchy across manufacturers

   - Mileage vs Price Relationship: Negative correlation as expected

   - Year of Manufacture Impact: Newer cars tend to have significantly higher prices

   - Outlier Detection: Identified extreme values using boxplots for targeted cleaning

Charts and detailed visuals are saved in the `report/Figures` folder.
